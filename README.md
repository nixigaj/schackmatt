# Schackmatt

A web based chess game. Play with your friends on any device with a web browser supporting modern web standards. The entire game is currently client-side only, but multiplayer support is planned for the future. A live production demo is available at [schackmatt.junsved.se](https://schackmatt.junsved.se).

## Building and running
Only tested on Linux and macOS. [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended for building and running on Windows.

### Dependencies

* npm

### Build

Clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/nixigaj/schackmatt.git

```

Install the dependencies with `npm install`.

Build with `npm run build`. The resulting build is located inside the `./build` directory.

### Run
